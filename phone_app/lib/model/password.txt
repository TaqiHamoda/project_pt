Tips on storing passwords:
    - Never store the password, store the hash instead.
    - Hash the function on the server.
    - Use PBKDF2 with SHA256, 100000 iterations, a random 128-bit number salt that is generated using CSPRNG, and the
      hash's length is 256 characters. To get a 128-bit random number use python os.urandom(16). Write your own PBKDF2
      function.
    - The salt is added to the end of the password before the hash is started.
    - Create a random salt for every password. Store the salt and hash in the database.
    - Use HTTPS when sending the information to and from the server (https://letsencrypt.org/) is for free.
